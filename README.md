# Supervised-Learning-Regression

This python file is for working on supervised machine learning algorithms which are, Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors. I have simple tabular dataset and made regression with this algoritmhs respectively and then predict test set from which of the best algorithm.
